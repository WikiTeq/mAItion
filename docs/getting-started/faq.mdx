## What is mAItion?

mAItion is an AI knowledge platform that ingests data from connectors and lets you chat with that data.

## Do I need OpenAI or OpenRouter to start?

Not for basic ingestion and retrieval. For rephrase/chat model calls, configure provider keys in env files.

## Why do I not see my documents in answers yet?

Most common causes:

- connector is not configured
- ingestion schedule did not run yet
- source credentials are wrong

Check connector env vars, `config.yaml`, and service health with `docker compose ps`.

## How often does data refresh?

Per connector schedule. Configure schedule env vars (in seconds), for example:

- `S3_ACCOUNT1_SCHEDULES`
- `MEDIAWIKI1_SCHEDULES`
- `SERPAPI1_SCHEDULES`

## Can I use multiple connectors at once?

Yes. You can enable multiple source types and multiple instances of the same type in `config.yaml`.

## Can I use multiple S3 accounts or buckets?

Yes. Add additional source entries and matching env vars (`S3_ACCOUNT2_*`, `S3_ACCOUNT3_*`, etc). You
can also configure individual connectors to use different buckets to keep provenance separate.

## What is the difference between frontend and backend env files?

- `.env.openwebui.example`: Frontend runtime and admin bootstrap settings
- `.env.rag.example`: RAG backend API/workers, connectors, rate limits, provider config

## Is `ENABLE_SIGNUP` required?

Keep `ENABLE_SIGNUP=True` on first start for admin auto-provisioning, then disable later for single-user/private mode.

## How can I improve answer quality?

- Keep sources fresh (shorter schedules)
- Use reliable embedding and inference models
