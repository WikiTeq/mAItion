![mAItion](window.png)

mAItion is an all-in-one, ready-to-use AI platform that combines your existing knowledge with large language models (LLMs).

It gives you a single chat interface to:

- chat with your data
- search across connected sources
- discover and refine knowledge from scattered systems

## How It Works

mAItion ingests data from connectors (like S3, MediaWiki,search sources and many more), indexes it, and makes it available for AI-powered retrieval and chat.

You can run local or remote models, configure ingestion pipelines, and adapt the platform for both personal and team workflows.

## Who It Is For

mAItion is built for teams and individuals who need one place to work with organizational knowledge, including:

- internal docs and wiki content
- cloud storage files
- external search context
- other 3rd party sources

## What You’ll Find In These Docs

This documentation covers setup, configuration, connectors, and day-to-day usage so you can get mAItion running quickly and customize it for your environment.
