mAItion is an all-in-one, ready-to-use AI platform that combines your existing knowledge
with large language models (LLMs).

It gives you a single chat interface to:

- Chat with your data

## How It Works

mAItion ingests data from connectors (like S3, MediaWiki,search sources and many more),
indexes it, and makes it available for AI-powered retrieval and chat.

You can run local or remote models, configure ingestion pipelines, and adapt the platform
for both personal and team workflows.

## Who It Is For

mAItion is built for teams and individuals who need one place to work with organizational
knowledge, including:

- Internal docs and wikis content
- Files stored in a cloud
- External search context
- Other 3rd party sources

## What You’ll Find In These Docs

This documentation covers Setup, Configuration, Connectors, and day-to-day usage so you can get
mAItion running quickly and customize it for your environment.
