mAItion keeps your knowledge base up to date by continuously ingesting
content from configured connectors.

## How It Works

- Each connector runs on its own schedule
- New and changed content is re-ingested
- Indexed data becomes available for chat and retrieval

## Why It Matters

- Answers reflect latest available source data
- Less manual sync work
- One place to query current internal knowledge

See [Connectors](/connectors) for more information.
